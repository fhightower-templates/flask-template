# Flask Template

This is a **minimal** [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) template that is ready for deployment to Heroku.

This template took inspiration from [https://github.com/datademofun/heroku-basic-flask](https://github.com/datademofun/heroku-basic-flask) and [https://github.com/candidtim/cookiecutter-flask-minimal](https://github.com/candidtim/cookiecutter-flask-minimal).
